            <h3>Hello, my name is Dennis Mayo.</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">I am originally from Wilson, North Carolina but moved to Snow Hill, North Carolina last year.
                I was originally working for a Bridgestone tire plant running a tire assembly machine but the job was taking a turn for the worst and after 13 years i figured 
                it was time to go back to school.  I wanted to get into coding full time, im currently working on getting a certificate in Full stack development with MERN from MIT.
                I have been messing around with some form of coding for the last 15+ years.   I originally started making mIRC scripts and took a Visual Basics class in high school.  
                While messing around with the mIRC scripts I started making basic web pages with HTML, CSS and very little PHP.  Messed around with web design for a few years off and on.
                Some of my friends started messing around with Kodi(a popular media center program), so i figured I would give it a chance.  I started learning python so i could create
                a maintenance style plugins for the Kodi.  After that with the help of a bootstrap template I found online I created a website for a local gun shop <a href="http://DeadOnTacticalArms.com">DeadOnTacticalArms</a>.
                Outside of what is included with the template and bootstrap i did all the frontend HTML, Javascript, and Jquery.  I also did all the backend PHP coding and created an admin panel for them.
                Now im working on getting my certificate from MIT xPro so i can become a Full Stack Developer.
